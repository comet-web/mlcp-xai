# mlcp-xai
This is our attempt to build maximally truth seeking AI using tweets from an imbalanced dataset. 

we will be using a dataset that is imbalanced initially or we make it so. 
we then build a baseline model on top of the imbalanced dataset (v1) and also a model on top the synthetic balanced dataset (it can be any balancing technique) (v2) 

we then compare v1 and v2.

using explainable ai methods.
