    "*   **High Imbalance:** The fraud cases (minority class) are only about 0.17% of all transactions, which is a significant imbalance (far below the 20% threshold).\n",
    "*   **Real-World Problem:** Fraud detection is a critical application where failing to detect the minority class has serious consequences.\n",

    "**Here's a summary of what we did and learned:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Problem:** We started with a credit card fraud dataset where fraudulent transactions were very rare (0.17%).\n",
    "2.  **Baseline Model:** Our initial Logistic Regression model was good at identifying non-fraud cases but failed to detect a large portion of the actual frauds (low recall).\n",
    "3.  **Oversampling:** We used an advanced oversampling technique, ADASYN, to create synthetic data for the minority class. This balanced our training data.\n",
    "4.  **Improved Model:** The model trained on the balanced data showed a massive improvement in **recall** (from 61% to 92%), meaning it could now identify most of the fraudulent transactions. This came at the cost of lower precision, which is a common trade-off.\n",
    "5.  **Explainable AI (XAI):** Using SHAP, we were able to look inside our model. We found which features were most important for detecting fraud (`V14`, `V12`, `V10`) and confirmed that our synthetic data was realistic and helped the model learn better.\n",
    "\n",
    "**In simple English:** We taught our computer to be a better fraud detective. At first, it was too cautious and missed many crimes. So, we showed it more examples of what fraud looks like (even creating some fake ones that looked real). After that, it became much better at catching the bad guys, even though it sometimes raised a false alarm. We also used a special tool (SHAP) to ask our computer *why* it thought a transaction was fraudulent, making its decisions easier to trust."
