# Project Documentation

Welcome to the mlcp-xai-ML project docs. This folder is a guided path to learn the project quickly and run end‑to‑end experiments on imbalanced classification with oversampling and XAI.

## Start Here
- Learning Path: `project_documentation/learning_path.md`
- Setup Guide: `project_documentation/setup_guide.md`
- How to Run: `project_documentation/running_the_project.md`
- Dataset Card: `project_documentation/dataset_card.md`

## Key Guides (already included)
- Comprehensive Project Guide: `project_documentation/imbalance_oversampling_xai_project_guide.md`
- Concepts:
  - `project_documentation/key_concepts/python_basics.md`
  - `project_documentation/key_concepts/numpy_pandas.md`
  - `project_documentation/key_concepts/scikit_learn_guide.md`
