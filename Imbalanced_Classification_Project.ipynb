I will build a baseline model, apply an advanced oversampling technique (ADASYN) to balance the dataset, train an improved model, and then use Explainable AI (XAI) to understand how the models make their decisions, especially concerning the synthetic samples."

This makes it much easier for the logistic regression model to learn a line (or hyperplane in higher dimensions) that separates the two classes, which is exactly what we saw in the improved model's performance. The synthetic samples genuinely help the classifier by making the decision boundary clearer.\n",

    "### 📦 Final Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "This project successfully demonstrated a complete workflow for handling an imbalanced classification problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Problem:** The baseline Logistic Regression model performed poorly on the imbalanced dataset, achieving a very low **recall** for the minority class.\n",
    "2.  **Solution:** By applying the **ADASYN** oversampling technique, I created a balanced training set. The model trained on this new data showed a massive improvement in performance, especially in recall, without a major sacrifice in precision.\n",
    "3.  **Explanation:** Using **SHAP**, I identified the key features driving the model's predictions. Furthermore, by visualizing the data with **PCA**, I confirmed that the synthetic samples generated by ADASYN were not just noise but were strategically placed to help the classifier learn a more effective decision boundary.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, this step-by-step process shows that simply training a model on imbalanced data is not enough. Techniques like ADASYN are crucial for building fair and effective models, and XAI tools like SHAP are invaluable for understanding and trusting their behavior."
